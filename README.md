# New keyboard

After pining for a mechanical Microsoft Natural keyboard for a long long time I finally discovered it! [`Moonlander Keyboard`](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander) and the excellet online layout and ROM flashing editor for it: [`Oryx`](https://configure.zsa.io/moonlander/layouts/dneZx/latest/0)

# New layout

So then you may as well learn a new key layout. Colemak-DH, after some research, seemed close enough to perfection. [`DreymaR's Colemak Site`](https://dreymar.colemak.org/training.html)

# New typing tutor

I searched for Mavis Beacon but she has left the building! RIP Mavis! I slowly discovered a collection of websites to train on:

- [`Ben Vallack`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI-a64EVPPU) For general The Joy of Typing inspiration.
- [`Cyanophage`](https://cyanophage.github.io/) Fantastic layout research on a lot of layouts.
- [`Keyboard Builder's Digest`](https://kbd.news/) One does not simply buy a keyboard.
- [`Hamaji Neo`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jtGYw22OBw) Your keyboard needs an upgrade, or something.
- [`Mechcables`](https://mechcables.com/products/samurai-aviator-cable) You kind of have to right?
- [`Adam Savage`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3FEv1qw4_w) Even Adam from Mythbusters is into mechanical keyboards.
- [`History`](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/fact-of-fiction-the-legend-of-the-qwerty-keyboard-49863249/) Enquiring minds want to know!
- [`monkeytype`](https://monkeytype.com/) I get my WPM baseline, graphed over time doing random timed texts, daily.
- [`keybr`](https://www.keybr.com/) I mainlined this from a-z with the hacked Ranel Padon ngrams aka Xgrams to focus around new key(s).
- [`ZTYPE`](https://zty.pe/) This is like 12 infinite monkeys typing, but with adrenaline.
- [`keyzen`](https://github.com/wwwtyro/keyzen) The original keyzen, that spawned numerous others. I hacked several to taste as I regained the ability to code.
- [`COLEMAK CLUB`](https://gnusenpai.net/colemakclub/) This taught me a few fingers at a time, mostly.
- [`keyzen3`](https://adamgradzki.com/keyzen3/) A keyzen with an interesting UI.
- [`Ngram Type`](https://ranelpadon.github.io/ngram-type/) More Keyzen, now with ngrams. I hacked this one so much I finally just rewrote it from scratch.

# Xgrams

- Inspired by the above, most directly descended from the last 4
- Pangrams to discover weak spots or efficiently typing all letters
- Large amounts of ngrams
- Filtering so you can hone in on specific keys and fingers
- Popular programming language keywords
- The fount of wisdom [Google ngram corpus](https://books.google.com/ngrams/)

# Tools

I went on a Javascript adventure. It makes me miss how superior Swift is.

- [`svelte`](https://svelte.dev/) I like the precompiling, code simplicity, and no runtime bloat.
- [`skeleton`](https://www.skeleton.dev/) I like where this is going and it is active.
- [`tailwindcss`](https://tailwindcss.com/) It's an approach and now with css vars too.
- [`TypeScript`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) What a learning curve. 2 steps sideways, one stumble forward.
- [`typia`](https://github.com/samchon/typia) No more dumb JSON wrangling. Just TypeScript + Typia.
- [`VS Code`](https://code.visualstudio.com/) Seems decent so far.
- [`typesafe-i18n`](https://github.com/ivanhofer/typesafe-i18n) Old full stack best practice habbits die hard.

# TODO

- Other parts of the [`JamStack`](https://jamstack.org/) Architecture?
- Host on GitHub Pages! Turns out you can host on [`vercel`](https://vercel.com/) in 3 minutes flat.
